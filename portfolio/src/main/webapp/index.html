                    <p1>Zoe represents "life" and that best describes my personality. 
                        I am an easy going funny Chicagoan that enjoys watching international television shows. 
                        I recently completed the final season of GoT and was left wanting a season 9. 
                        There were story lines that were left unfinished and Aria could have had a spin off show 
                        called "The Girl is No One". I like to problem solve. I like thinking about systematized ways
                         of solving problems. When I was a little girl, I liked to watch Dora the Explorer and what 
                         fascinated me most was her ability to use her skill set to find solutions within her 
                         surrounds. Friendship is very important to me. I value the connections I have made with 
                         people on my educational journey as they increase my level of happiness, provide support 
                         during stressful situations, improve my self-worth and confidence. In the words of Winnie 
                         the Pooh, 
                         "a friend is one of the nicest things you can have and one of the best things you can be".
